# Advance_Cplusplus
## This course is inspired from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/learn/lecture/3688056#overview) by [John Purcell](https://www.udemy.com/user/johnpurcell/). The examples are here totally different from his examples.

### [Exception Handling](Exception-Handling):
+ [Basic](Exception-Handling/Basic) has basic ideas how `try`, `throw`, and `catch` commands in C++ works. It throws an error if any number is divided by zero. This example is written in Class which gives some ideas about class also. 
+ [Bad_alloc](Exception-Handling/Bad_alloc) has an example of memory allocation.
