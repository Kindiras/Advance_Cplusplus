# Advance_Cplusplus
## This course is inspired from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/learn/lecture/3688056#overview) by [John Purcell](https://www.udemy.com/user/johnpurcell/). The examples here are totally different from his examples.

### [Exception Handling](Exception-Handling):
+ [Basic](Exception-Handling/Basic) has basic ideas how `try`, `throw`, and `catch` commands in C++ works. It throws an error if any number is divided by zero. This example is written in Class which gives some ideas about class also. 
+ [Bad_alloc](Exception-Handling/Bad_alloc) has an example of memory allocation.
+ [Custom-Exception](Exception-Handling/Custom-Exception) has basic example to customize own exception.
+ [SubclassException](Exception-Handling/SubclassException) is an example from [John Purcell](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/learn/lecture/3688058#overview) showing that child class should be called first and then parent class in handling exception.
### [StructExample](StructExample)
  + This gives an idea about ```struct``` in c++. For more info see [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/structures/)

### [LinkListExamples](LinkListExamples)
   + Thses examples give clear idea about link list. This title was not tought in udemy. Go over it and get the clear ideas. 
### [ReadWriteFiles](ReadWriteFiles)
+ [TextFiles](ReadWriteFiles/TextFiles)This foleder has examples that show how to read write text files in c++, write_files.cpp writes the test.txt file while ReadFile.cpp reads the file line by line. 
+ [BinaryFiles](ReadWriteFiles/BinaryFiles) give some ideas about reading and writting the binary files in c++.
### [Vector](Vectors)
 + [Basics](Vectors/Basics) has some examples which can give some sort of basic ideas about vector in c++.
 + [2D-Vector](Vectors/Two-Dimensional-Vectors) is declared as vector< vector<int> > grid(row,vector<int>(columns,values)).
 + [2D-VectorInClass](Vectors/VectorInClass) has nice example of vector in class in c++.
### [List](list):
  + This example from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/learn/lecture/3688260#questions) gives an idea about list in c++.
### [Map](Maps):
  + It has basic idea about map in c++.
### [Set](Sets):
  + It has basic example about set in c++ from [John](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/learn/lecture/3688272?LSNPUBID=vedj0cWlu2Y&components=buy_button%2Cdiscount_expiration%2Cgift_this_course%2Cpurchase%2Cdeal_badge%2Credeem_coupon&ranEAID=vedj0cWlu2Y&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=vedj0cWlu2Y-wZ8Rmq6B9RugM0ggThLC.A&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign#announcements)
### [StackAndQues](StackAndQues):
  + This example gives basic ideas about Stack and Queue in c++.
### [SortingVector](SortingVectorFriend):
  + This has examples of how to sort the vectors' element as well as friend function prototype in c++.
