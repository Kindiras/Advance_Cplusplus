# Advance_Cplusplus
## This course is inspired from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/learn/lecture/3688056#overview) by [John Purcell](https://www.udemy.com/user/johnpurcell/). The examples here are totally different from his examples.

### [Exception Handling](Exception-Handling):
+ [Basic](Exception-Handling/Basic) has basic ideas how `try`, `throw`, and `catch` commands in C++ works. It throws an error if any number is divided by zero. This example is written in Class which gives some ideas about class also.

### [StructExample](StructExample)
  + This gives an idea about ```struct``` in c++. For more info see [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/structures/)
### [ReadWriteFiles](ReadWriteFiles)
+ [TextFiles](ReadWriteFiles/TextFiles)This foleder has examples that show how to read write text files in c++, write_files.cpp writes the test.txt file while ReadFile.cpp reads the file line by line. 
+ [BinaryFiles](ReadWriteFiles/BinaryFiles) give some ideas about reading and writting the binary files in c++.
